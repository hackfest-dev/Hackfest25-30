# 3D Drone Delivery Simulation

## Project Overview
A 3D simulation environment where multiple drones operate to deliver packages efficiently. The simulation includes drone movement, battery management, and delivery logistics.

## Core Features

### 1. Drone Management
- Multiple drones operating simultaneously
- Each drone has its own base (represented by green dots)
- Drones can be tracked individually
- Battery level monitoring for each drone

### 2. Delivery Process
1. Initial State:
   - All drones start at their respective bases
   - Bases are represented by green dots in the 3D environment

2. Simulation Flow:
   - On simulation start, drones move to pickup locations
   - After pickup, drones proceed to drop locations
   - Delivery completion triggers next action based on battery level

3. Battery Management:
   - Drones monitor their battery levels
   - If sufficient battery remains, continue to next delivery
   - If battery is low, navigate to nearest recharge station
   - Recharge stations are fixed locations in the environment

### 3. Environment
- 3D visualization of the delivery area
- Interactive camera controls
- Visual representation of:
  - Drone bases (green dots)
  - Pickup locations
  - Drop locations
  - Recharge stations
  - Drone paths and trajectories
